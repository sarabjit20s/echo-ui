import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';


This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

All components are made with [`react-native-unistyles`](https://www.unistyl.es/).

<Callout type='warn' title="Development preview">
These components are currently in development and may subject to change. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sarabjit20s/echo-ui/issues).

### Web Accessibility Notice

All components are specifically designed and optimized for mobile development (iOS and Android) using React Native. As such, certain features, such as keyboard navigation and other web-specific accessibility functionalities, are not supported.

While the components may render on the web, they are not intended for use in web applications. We recommend using them exclusively for mobile development to ensure the best user experience and accessibility.

If you're building for the web, consider exploring libraries specifically tailored for web accessibility and functionality.
